Python program to scrape Cars Ireland website and fetch info on well known brands

I have a passing interest in car buying and the prices associated with various models second hand. I
often noted how different brands and models often carry price premium. The changes in motor taxation
in Ireland have also had an effect on cars of certain engine capacity and fuel type. Also, traditional brand
favourites in Ireland anecdotally have moved towards Asian brands in recent years as price has become
a key factor.

My aim was to retrieve as much data as I could on sales of second hand cars online and analyze whether
some theories about how aspects like, age fuel type and mileage etc affect price but also how these
factors affect each other. For instance; do diesel cars on average have more mileage, do certain brands
still carry a price premium, do people from Cork really buy/sell more red cars than other counties.
